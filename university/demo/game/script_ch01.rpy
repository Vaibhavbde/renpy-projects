    "Kim didn’t want to get out of bed."

    "She’d expected to be more excited to start freshman orientation today, but her body 
    apparently had other plans. It refused to move."

    "Which was fair. Yesterday had involved a lot more walking and moving things around 
    than she expected."

    "An initial round of unpacking in her dorm, a helpful local shopping trip at Tansei’s 
    behest to cover anything missing, an evening stroll through Khamerra District 
    looking for dinner…"

    "{i}Not to mention warp lag{/i}, Kim reasoned. Of course her internal clock was off."

    "She shifted in bed, clutching the sheets near her face. It was a new bed and a new 
    set of sheets, but they were comfortable enough right now."

    "???" "\“Oi, Kim. You getting up?\”"

    "A sharp voice in the room, louder and closer than she wanted. She grunted and rolled 
    over, squinting against the light."

    "It was brighter than she wanted it to be, but she couldn’t ignore that her roommate, 
    Luziim, was already fully dressed."

    ki "Oh, jeez, what time is it?"

    l "About nine-thirty. Not late yet, but you might wanna get those legs of yours 
    moving."

    ki "Do my legs seriously make me that much faster than you?"

    # [Sprite: Luziim makes a show of scowling animatedly over all this.]

    l "God, I hope not.{nw=0.5}"
    # [Sprite: Luziim jerks a thumb over her shoulder.] 
    l "God, I hope not.{fast} I was a sprint record holder in high school, back on 
    Anaziim! I’d never live it down!"

    l "‘Yo, whatever happened to Luziim Oshan?’ ‘Oh, she went off-world and got beat by 
    the first schmuck she met with {i}legs{/i}.’"

    l "Nope, ain’t gonna let that happen."

    # [Sprite: after a beat, she cracks a smile.]
    l "...Pff, I’m teasing. If you’re faster than me, I’ll accept gracious defeat. 
    Promise."

    ki "Tch. If it makes you feel any better, legs won’t help me get dressed any faster."

    "Fortunately, Kim {i}had{/i} had the foresight to expedite today’s dressing process by 
    setting an outfit aside last night."

    "Granted, that was because today called for some specific gear: hiking clothes."

    "Their orientation schedule had them slated to hike out to Resshan Peak and camp at a 
    site there for their first night, before riding back tomorrow and resuming activities 
    on campus."

    "It was a little unusual, but exciting."

    "She dressed quickly, then double-checked the small backpack she’d set aside for 
    toiletries and spare clothes. Toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, sunscreen… all was 
    accounted for."

    l "What’s that stuff?"

    show luziim with fadeinleft

    ki "Hm? What?"

    "She lifted the bottle of sunscreen still in her hand. And then it dawned on her why 
    Luziim was puzzled."

    ki "Oh! Right. This is sunscreen. We wear it to protect our skin from getting burned 
    from UV rays. It’s like a lotion."

    # [Sprite: Luziim quirks a brow.]

    l "Your skin is flammable in sunlight?"

    ki "I- what? No, no, we don’t catch fire! That’d be silly—"

    # [Sprite: Luziim laughs.]

    "Luziim burst into a cackle."

    l "Pahahaha! Nah, nah, I’m teasing! Had you for a good sec, though."

    ki "Hoo, boy, you got me. Should’ve known you were pulling my leg."

    l "Pulling your what?"

    ki "Oh, sorry, that’s an idiom. For, like, messing with someone, leading them on as a 
    joke. ‘Pulling their leg,’ is the phrase."

    l "Why the leg?"

    ki "Uh, I dunno. I think that’s of English origin, or something."

    l "Psh. Always you people with the legs. Are legs your favorite body part or 
    something? Is the soul stored in the legs?"

    ki "No, no, that’s—"

    l "Are we zanduul doomed soulless beasts, with no legs to pull?"

    ki "I— no, no!"

    l "Ha ha! Okay, you’re way too easy to fluster, Kim."

    ki "H-hey! I don’t want to offend people, and if I get called out I’ll quickly correct 
    it."

    l "Alright, alright. It’s all good. Good to be aware, I’ll say."

    ki "I try, at least."

    # [Sound: rustling of cloth or a heavy bag.]

    ki "Anyway, I’m ready. You ready to go?"

    l "Aw, hell yeah!"

    l "Seriously, a hiking and camping trip during orientation? I’ve been hyped for 
    months."

    ki "I know, right? Me too!"

    "They latched their door behind them and made for the stairwell."

    "Or at least, Kim mistakenly expected there to be a stairwell here, before she 
    arrived and was reminded that there was a ramp here instead."

    "Luziim took to the ramp without hesitating. Kim realized after a moment that that 
    made plenty of sense."

    "Jokes about legs or lack thereof aside, Luziim’s species, the {i}zanduul{/i} of the planet 
    Anaziim, was distinctive." 

    "The long (and presumably keen) nose and ears, the parietal eye on the brow, the 
    elongated neck, the slithering body of course…"

    "And that was only the physical. More troublingly, zanduul were supposedly an 
    endangered species. It was some luck of the draw that Kim had received one as a 
    roommate."

    "Not that Kim expected any obstacles, at least on Luziim’s end. The other girl was 
    exuberantly friendly. Almost too friendly."

    "Kim planned to keep her wits about her regardless, but at least so far, the chances 
    were high that Luziim was not the type to be easily offended. That was a welcome 
    stroke of luck."

    holding what seemed to be signs, handwritten in large block letters in colored

    clicked."

    l "...Shar-trooze? The fuck? Standard is dumb."

    ki "I’m pretty sure that’s a French loanword."

    l "Standard’s still dumb for taking it."

    ki "What, a creole language can’t be a huge pile of loadwords? What else is it 
    supposed to be?"

    l "It could be a creole without twenty thousand pronunciation rules! At least unify 
    the spelling, sheesh."

    \“Team Cerulean\” and \“Team Cornflower\” and heavens knew what else..."

    "Aha! Among all of the red herrings, she finally spied the requisite sign 
    in the distance. She began to pick her way across the lawn towards it."

    "The leader holding the Team Cobalt sign had a small group sitting in front of him in 
    a vaguely circular shape already."

    nn "Oh! You need {i}your{/i} brunch! I nearly forgot."

    "Nanneyo rose to her feet and made for the kitchen to prepare Ash’s food and water 
    bowls."

    "Not that such a self-sufficient being couldn’t feed himself—he definitely had 
    before—but owning a pet was a responsibility, and Nanneyo was loath to feel that 
    she’d shirked that responsibility."

    "The first thing she’d done after move-in, naturally, was a grocery run. For one, as 
    much as she enjoyed the walk to campus, making it for every single meal and snack 
    was hardly feasible."

    "For another, and more urgently, Ash’s sustenance was an issue. None of the school’s 
    meal plans included Biot kibble or IV drips, so she’d had to take matters into her 
    own hands quickly."

    "…Well, she didn’t have to, technically. Biots had chemical energy reserves, much 
    like the fat deposits of real animals."

    "But she wouldn’t have starved a pet cat on purpose, either. That was just mean."

    # [SFX: kibble in a bowl.] 
    
    "He perked up in her peripheral vision the moment the kibble hit the bowl, not at 
    all unlike her family’s pet {i}khorana{/i} back home."

    "The excitement of a pet at the sound of food was truly universal."

    "As she turned away to fetch a water pitcher, Ash was already trotting over and 
    dropping onto all fours, wagging his stubby little tail."

    "A biped dropping to all fours to eat like a dog did look rather ridiculous, but 
    that was part of Biots’ odd charm."

    "There was something about how simple and excited it looked that, despite the 
    clumsiness, warmed Nanneyo’s heart.{nw=1.0}"
    extend " Or tickled her funny bone, at the very least."

    # [SFX: a knock at the door.]

    "Alas, just as she finished filling her water pitcher, there came a knock."

    nn "Ah, coming!"

    "She hastily swept towards the front door, setting the pitcher next to Ash as he 
    scarfed his dry food down. He was smart enough to pour his own water bowl, she 
    reasoned."
