    "Monday came and went in a whirlwind."

    "Each class was a new experience. A different room to find on campus, a different teacher to 
    meet, a different thematic energy."

    "Still, there was an undercurrent of commonality. This week was a week of firsts." 

    "Each class had to take its first session, either Monday or Tuesday, to lay down its 
    expectations, generally in the form of a printed handout."

    "Much of the process reminded her of high school, of course. The expectation of class 
    attendance and coursework was obvious, and each student she passed in the halls bore a 
    purpose in their stride."

    "And yet in other ways, the process hardly felt like high school at all."

    "Every building on campus was an art piece, boasting an extravagant entryway adorned by a 
    vaulted ceiling, or immense windows, or a sculpture."

    "The hallways were pristine, even luxuriously carpeted if you peeked down the ones where 
    professors’ offices were situated."

    "There were no lockers crowding the space, because they were unnecessary here, what with 
    students living on campus."

    "And that was the most jarring thought of all: {i}she could go home in the middle of the day.{/i}"

    "It was disorienting to have so much freedom. But convenient, she had to admit."

    "So that was what she was doing now, again, at 3 in the afternoon on Tuesday: walking back 
    to her dorm, again, because she wasn’t sure what to do with herself."

    "Of course, each time she did this, the route had been through a different section of campus, 
    which was fascinating in its own right."

    "Her current one took her through the plaza outside the science complex, on the north edge 
    of which was a little open-air café beneath a gazebo."

    "She hesitated. Perhaps she could spend the next half hour here with a cup of tea and a 
    snack, rather than returning “home” for a measly twenty minutes…"

    "???" "“Ah, excuse me! Kim?”"

    "Someone calling her name, however, was more pressing. She spun around in surprise."

    have to look up a word sooner or later."

    native speakers, right? Because if it didn’t, it would still be considered a pidgin."

    ka @ talk "I’m sorry, a what-language? And why is it a pigeon?"

    ki "Oh, sorry, let me back up."

    ki "When two unrelated languages come into contact with each other, and people have to 
    come up with a janky halfway point to communicate, that middle ground is called a pidgin 
    language."

    ki "Like, it’s a special lingo that people use to try to cross a language barrier."

    ki "But if the pidgin gets popular enough that people speak it all the time, instead of 
    just when they need it, to the point that their kids speak it as a first language, then it 
    officially isn’t a pidgin anymore. It’s a creole."

    ka @ talk "So… a pidgin language is a hybrid language that’s temporary, like a code, but a creole 
    language is what happens when a pidgin language gets big enough to have native speakers?"

    ki "Yep! I remember reading somewhere when I was a kid that Standard was a pidgin, but 
    much later I remember hearing it be called a creole, so it must’ve gotten promoted 
    sometime in the middle, after a census or something."

    "It was good to see Luziim and Karalún seeming to get along. After their awkward 
    introduction, Kim had been worried."

    "And goodness, how time could fly when one was chatting with friends! She hadn’t realized 
    it was nearly 3:30 already."

    "Thankfully she’d noticed early enough not to be running truly late. She had a good twelve 
    minutes to find her way to the music building, one of the last academic buildings on campus 
    she had yet to visit."

    # [background: choir hall]
    show bg music_choirroom

    "The hallways in this building were comparatively tame, but the rehearsal spaces were grand 
    and vaulting. This choir room was no exception."

    "Risers formed an arc around one side of the room, upon which rows of chairs had been 
    crowded. Many students were seated already."

    "Were they supposed to find their own voice sections? Better to try than not, at least."

    "So she picked her way a few columns over, roughly to where she supposed the mezzo sopranos 
    should be."

    "There was a printed handout, just like all the others she’d received for her classes so far, 
    sitting on each unclaimed seat. She picked one up and settled into place."

    "It didn’t take much longer for the choir director to call everyone to settle down."

    "And then it was more of the same: a welcome to the class for the semester, and a 
    walkthrough of the printed handout."

    "Due to being a pass-fail activity course rather than a graded course, this printout was 
    shorter than most, which made sense. Kim dutifully skimmed along as the instructor walked 
    through it."

    "In between the key points of the syllabus, idle thoughts of Luziim and Karalùn filled in 
    the gaps."

    "Kim had known about the Searing of Anaziim for years. And yet she had failed to consider 
    its implications when interacting in person."

    "To think she could’ve caused an incident, if Luziim hadn’t been so friendly!"

    "She was so curious about the both of them now. Karalùn obviously had an unusual story, but 
    so did Luziim on the flipside. What had they both been through?"

    # [SFX: rustling of crowd moving]

    "Suddenly the other students around her were rising to her feet."

    "Oops, she must’ve missed the director’s call to rise so they could warm up."

    "But after she popped to her feet, she saw that the others weren’t standing at attention. 
    They were gathering their things."

    "Had the class been dismissed early?"

    "It was a baffling choice, and a disappointing one. She’d come here all excited to sing!"

    "Oh, well. She deflated a little as she stooped to gather her backpack, then joined the 
    throng filtering out the door."

    "???" "“Kim!”"

    "She froze."

    "She spun on her heel and scanned the crowd. Was someone calling her? She only knew a measly 
    handful of people on campus so far."

    alright to ask."

    be understanding when it happens."

    nn "(Hey, be nice within earshot.)"

    f "(Sorry.)"

    b "But hey, all that to say, we feel your pain! You showed up and just wanted to sing, 
    damnit!"

    b "Which is why we started using the tail end of class periods to stick around and work on 
    our own stuff. And you are welcome to join us."

    ki "Oh, I… you mean, right now?"

    "This was unexpected. Now that she’d mentally surrendered the class period, she had to take 
    a moment to recalibrate."

    f "Well, let’s not be too pushy with the recruitment, now. We’ve hardly even met."

    f "So, how do you and Nan know each other? I’m curious."

    ki "Oh, she helped me at check-in last week."

    nn "Yep! You were one of the S-names in my line."

    nn "I still think ‘Kim’ is super cute, by the way."

    ki "Oh, uh, thanks!"

    ki "It’s kind of an international shortening of my name, ha ha. It doesn’t work super well 
    natively. My mom thinks it sounds weird."

    ki "But my dad and my friends think it’s cute, so, I’ll call that a win?"

    nn "I’d call that a win!"

    b "I like it too. Though I have an Anglophone bias, so take that with a grain of salt."

    nn "Anyway, back to the earlier point. We definitely don’t want to bully you into anything, 
    but you’re totally invited to stick around with us after rehearsal whenever you want."

    ki "Oh, yeah, for sure! Sounds like a good idea. I’ve got no objections, not if it's within 
    the normal class time slot."

    ki "Do you normally just work on the choir pieces more, or do you do personal stuff?"

    b "Depends on how we feel. The former if we feel we need to figure something out, but the 
    personal pieces are more fun, y’know?"

    f "He says that because he likes to test his compositions on us."

    "Blake stiffened and tapped a folder under his arm."

    b "Hey, I think it’s fair to want to hear what I’ve written in actual voices in range. Try 
    singing these in my falsetto and see how {i}you{/i} like it."

    "Nanneyo giggled at that."

    nn "Did you ever follow up on changing your emphasis, like you said? I remember you saying 
    you were considering switching from performance to composition."

    b "Ah, crap, not yet. Remind me to talk to Professor Achren next time he’s feeling better."

    ki "So you write your own music, then? That’s really cool!"

    b "Ah, thanks! I try, at least."

    b "These two keep insisting I take it professional, bank my music major on it. Not sure I’m 
    quite that cocky."

    nn "Aww, but you’re good!"

    b "Your praise is appreciated. I’ll take it into consideration."

    b "Hey, speaking of which, I’ve been working on some new stuff over summer break, if we all 
    want to take a look?"
